# Front-end

WingMe utilizes AngularJS and Ionic Components to render the front-end. We used the industry-standard ui-router for application routing and built-in Angular factories for state management.

All API calls are made in the corresponding factory file associated for the type of data that it’s maintaining.

# Back-end

WingMe’s custom RESTFul API is built with Node.js and Express, and data management is handled by KnexJS and SQLite.
